#+TITLE: Personal Math Notes

To read the notes in your web browser of choice, please view: [[juvenigi.github.io/mathnotes]]

* Who is this for

primarily me, because I would like to have portable and version-controlled math
notes and proofs in a nearly format-agnostic way (I want to replace LaTeX with a different,
mroe structured notation that can be easily be converted into Metamath, I will
possibly just use metamath notation in the end)

* Content breakdown

** Winter Semester 2019-2020 (WS 2019-20)
modules:

- Linear Algebra Ⅰ
- Analysis Ⅰ
- Numerical Analysis plus Discrete Mathematics Ⅰ /(Algorithmische Mathematik Ⅰ)/

* Note
also check out [[http://github.com/juvenigi/alma]] for programming exercises in C++ (please
note that they're not a good example how to code, for that refer to Rosetta Code
or similar sources). I was also lazy to manage dependencies for my projects,
and I want to slowly compartmentalize code.
